# Welcome to the Focus Bear Intern Onboarding Repository! 🚀

## 🌟 About Your Learning Journey
Welcome to your first task as a Focus Bear intern! This repository is designed to guide you through your onboarding process by providing **structured learning materials** and **practical tasks**. You’ll start by setting up your own project repository, which will serve as a workspace for your internship. This will help you become comfortable with GitHub workflows, automation, and best practices.

## Step 1: Duplicate this repository (including the issues)

Head on over to duplicate-repo/README.md for that process

## Step 2: Work through the issues in your repo

Now that you've duplicated this repository including all the issues, you can start working through the learning tasks in the issues.

Start with milestone #1 (they get increasingly more complex)

The rules:
- **Recognition of prior learning**: If you've already got a public repo where you have demonstrated a skill, you don't have to repeat it. Just add a comment to the issue pointing to the existing code you've written. (But make sure you fully understand it)
- **Use of AI tools**: It's ok to use AI tools to help you but don't blindly copy and paste code without testing it. The point of doing this is so you understand these concepts. If you don't fully grasp the concepts, you'll be out of your depth when you get access to the Focus Bear codebase.
- **Question everything**: This is the first time we're running a structured onboarding program and we may have missed the mark. If you think an assignment is unnecessary or think the skill could be demonstrated another way, leave comments on the issue so we can improve it.

## Step 3: Submit your work for review

When you have completed all the issues, you can let your team leader know so they can review and give you feedback. If it's all looking good, you'll move to the next stage: helping develop the Focus Bear app.
